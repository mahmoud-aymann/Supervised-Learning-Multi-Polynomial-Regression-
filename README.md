# Supervised Learning: Multiple & Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates supervised machine learning techniques using multiple linear regression and polynomial regression models.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is **health insurance data**, which includes the following features:

- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children
- `smoker`: Smoking status
- `region`: Residential region
- `charges`: Insurance cost (target variable)

The goal is to predict the insurance charges based on these features.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, splitting)
- Training multiple regression models
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing the regression results
